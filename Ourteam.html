			</h3>
			<p class="about">Dr. Gotlib runs the <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/mood/cgi-bin/wordpress/" target="_blank">Stanford Mood and Anxiety Disorders Lab</a>. In his research, Dr. Gotlib is examining psychological and biological factors that place individuals at increased risk for depression, as well as processes that are involved in recovery from this disorder. He is conducting research examining cognitive, social, and endocrinological factors and genetics in depressed individuals, patterns of brain function and structure that characterize depressed and anxious adults and children, and predictors of depression in children at familial risk for developing this disorder. Dr. Gotlib is also examining the impact of innovative cognitive and neural procedures both to treat depression and to reduce young childrenâ€™s risk of developing depression.

			<p class="about">I am a project coordinator at the Stanford Mood and Anxiety Disorders Lab and recently received my B.A. in Human Biology with a concentration in Neurobiological Development and Disorder from Stanford University in 2016. I am interested in the factors which influence the trajectory of neural development and I will be working to coordinate the BABIES project. I plan to pursue a career as a physician and have a special interest in neuroscience and mental health.

Prior to coming to Stanford I obtained pre- and postdoctoral training in Infant Mental Health at Tulane University School of Medicine and a Ph.D. in clinical psychology at UCLA in 2014. I am interesting in learning more about children's development and the role that parents play in fostering positive growth.

I have clinical and research interests in adult mental health, particularly psychiatric disorders during the perinatal period including postpartum depression.  I am involved in the BABIES study to work on assessment with the mothers and hopefully develop future interventions to help patients during the challenging emotional transition to parenthood.

			</h3>
			<p class="about">I am a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Ian Gotlib's Stanford Mood and Anxiety Disorders Lab, and received my Ph.D. in cognitive psychology/neuroscience from UC San Diego in 2012. Prior to joining the Gotlib lab, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UC San Francisco, where I used functional neuroimaging approaches to understand adolescent depression and suicidality. At Stanford, I will be combining structural and functional neuroimaging methods to better understand neural risk mechanisms for depression and suicidal behaviors. I am interested in developing brain-based models of psychopathology, with the goal that this work will inform current prevention and treatment efforts.

			</h3>
			<p class="about">I am a Ph.D. student in the Stanford Mood and & Anxiety Disorders Laboratory and I am assisting on protocol development, training, and data analysis for the BABIES study. I am broadly interested in how the early environment affects long-term mental health and resilience. My research focuses on the development of stress reactivity and regulation in children exposed to early life stress, as well as factors that foster wellbeing, such as positive parenting. In addition, I am focused on improving how scientists measure positive and negative experiences in early life. Before arriving at Stanford, I worked on studies of mental health following childhood exposure to disasters and the effects of perinatal stress and parenting on biological reactivity and regulation in 6-month-old infants.

			<p class="about">I joined the Gotlib lab as a research coordinator in June of 2015. I work closely with BABIES participants during their sessions at Stanford, and ensure everything runs smoothly.  Prior to coming to Stanford, I received my B.A. in Psychology and Children's Studies from Washington University in St. Louis. In the future, I hope to continue my work in research, and gain further understanding into development in early life and psychopathology.

			<p class="about">I joined the lab as a research coordinator in 2015 after graduating from Stanford University with a degree in psychology and Spanish. In the lab, I do MRI scans and interviews with all age ranges of our participants. My main role in the BABIES study is to work with the mothers during their sessions at Stanford and to assist at the scan sessions. I am interested in how early experiences affect brain development and emotional and psychological health long-term.

			<p class="about">I am a project coordinator in the Mood and Anxiety Disorders lab at Stanford University. I started working as part of the lab's scan team after I graduated from Whitman College with a degree in psychology and biology. As a member of the scan team I interact with participants, manage fMRI data, and operate the MRI scanner. I work closely with parents and babies during the scan session to make sure the child is safe and as comfortable as possible throughout the entire process. I enjoy working with kids and am especially interested in learning about early life experiences and development. I hope to pursue a career that is focused around providing support and opportunities for children from a variety of backgrounds.

			MRIs and brain development over the years, so feel free to ask me questions
			 about the scanner or about what's going on in your baby's brain when you
