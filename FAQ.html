<h1> General Overview </h1>
<h3>What happens when you join the BABIES Project:</h3>
<p>There are several components to the study that help us to learn about infant development and families. This includes an <b>interview</b> with mothers about themselves, their children, and their family (child care can be arranged for your baby during this visit).</p>

<p>Then, we conduct an <b>MRI scan</b> with the infant when he or she is sleeping. We ask mothers and infants to do some activities together in our lab rooms, which includes collecting saliva samples using a small cotton tube from both mom and baby at repeated times during the visit.</p>

<p>If mothers prefer to do some activities in their homes or over the phone, we can arrange for these accommodations in most cases. Further, we allow for participants to schedule these pieces at as few as two visits to Stanford or to break them into smaller, shorter sessions.</p>

<a id="question1"> 
<h3>1. How old does my child need to be to be included in the study?</h3> </a>
<p>Babies age six months or younger can be scheduled and screened, with the goal of scanning participants at age six months.</p>
<hr>
<a id="question2">
<h3>2. What is the time commitment for the study?</h3></a>
<p>The time commitment is 3 to 10 hours over 1 to 2 visits.</p>
<hr>
<a id="question3">
<h3>3. When do sessions occur? Can I do weekend/evening appointments?</h3></a>
<p> We schedule sessions around your availability, including daytime, evenings, and weekends. The scan will occur in the evening, near your child's bedtime.</p>
<hr>
<a id="question4">
<h3>4. Can I bring my other children with me?</h3> </a>
<p> Yes, just let us know ahead of time how many to expect and we can arrange for child care to be provided during your visits.</p>
<hr>
<a id="question5">
<h3>5. Will I be paid for study participation?</h3></a>
<p>We pay $25 an hour for your time, and we also provide thank you gifts for you and your baby (e.g., junior scientist t-shirt, board book, toy, a developmental Fact Sheet).</p>
<hr>
<a id="question6">
<h3>6. What will you do?</h3></a>
<p>If eligible, you and your child will have the opportunity to visit Stanford University to participate in interviews, do questionnaires, participate in structured parent-child interactions, and participate in an fMRI brain scan.</p>
<hr>
<a id="question7">
<h3>7. Aren't MRI scans dangerous? Is MRI like an X-ray or CT scan?</h3></a>
<p>No. Unlike PET and X-ray scans, MRI does not involve any radiation and has no known health risks when performed correctly. Instead, MRI uses a large magnet to take pictures of your child's brain while he or she is asleep.</p>
<hr>
<a id="question8">
<h3>8. Does the MRI require sedation?</h3></a>
<p>No. We do not use any medication. We wait until your baby falls asleep in order to get clear images though the scan.</p>
<hr>
<a id="question9">
<h3>9. How long will my baby be in the scanner?</h3></a>
<p>Sometimes it takes babies a little while to fall asleep, but active scanning lasts less than an hour.</p>
<hr>
<a id="question10">
<h3>10. How can I participate in this study?</h3></a>
<p>We screen each participant by phone to ensure eligibility before scheduling your first session. You can call (650-736-2318) email (<a href="mailto:mood@psych.stanford.edu" target="_top">mood@psych.stanford.edu</a>), or fill out this online form to let us know you are interested in being contacted for the phone screen.</p>
<hr>
<a id="question11">
<h3>11. I have friends who also have young infants. Could they also participate in one of your studies?</h3></a>
<p>Great! Please do tell your friends who may be interested. We are always looking for volunteers and can keep your names on file in case the ages we are currently studying changes.</p>
